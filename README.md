A simple way of displaying design mockups in a webpage for review


Used for review of images by clients. 

To set it up:

1. Add the images you want to display to the /mockups
directory.
2. Add the file names of the images to index.html (around Line 23):
	For example, 
	aa.mockups = ['home-mockup.jpg', 'about-mockup.png', 'registration-mockup.jpg'];                 

Add the file names in the order you'd like them displayed.

I normally create a directory inside the Public directory of my Dropbox, 
then grab the Public link for the index.html file and give that to a client.
